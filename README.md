# ðŸ‘‹Welcome 
to my Github profile. Here you can find some projects I made. Plugins, discord bots, websites and whatever else I will try to program.  
I plan to use Github to save and share my progress and projects in programming. This and the reason that I will probably not actively update some projects, leads of course to the fact that especially older code, due to later learned knowledge, may not be very clean or performant.
## ðŸ“ˆ Statistics
